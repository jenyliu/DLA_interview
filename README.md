# DLA_interview

## Objective
I would like to look at a new generative model used to learn an underlying distribtuion of a dataset. The technique is Real NVP as detailed in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.08803.pdf.
There are many versions of the code available online, but I would ike to look at the official release available in tensorflow for Python 2.7 since it was written by the authors of the paper and provides correct functions that other versions have made minor changes to. I hope to be able to recreate the results detailed in the paper onthe 2D data generated myself and the imae databases used in the paper. I may also experiment with the network on otehr data sets like MNIST to see how it works on data outside what is described in the paper.
